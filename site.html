<h1> <br> <br>The dark side of COVID-19 closure is the increase in domestic violence and fewer reports of domestic violence</h1>
<h2> Abstract: </h2>
<p> Domestic violence has always been bizarre in our country and 
the COVID-19 related lockdown made the situation worse. 
During the period of lockdown/quarantine, women feel a very bad situation and an increase in domestic violence. 
As compared to the last 10years as per data 86% of women who experience domestic violence do not seek help and 
77% of the victims did have to disclose the circumstance to anyone. Data purpose that in 2020 between March to 
May 1477 complaints of domestic violence were made by women during the period of lockdown. Cases of domestic 
violence break the record of the last 10 years. </p>

 detection strategies. </P>
<h2> 1. Introduction: </h2>
<p> Domestic violence is violence against women, children and, partners which could be mental or physical. The 
World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that domestic violence can be perpetrated in the following ways:
<br> 1. Physical (beating, torture, murder);</br>
<br> 2. sex (unwanted intercourse, harassment, sex joke);</br>
<br> 3. psychology (manipulation, threats, humiliation, intimidation);</br>
<br> 4. Economic (forced control of finances; deduction of money);</br>
<br> 5. Tracing (chasing, forced checking of calls or messages). [1,2]</br>
In domestic violence, the person in the family is beaten by other family members in the home but in most cases, 
it is found in couples, and the woman is harassed and found difficulty in living in their own home. "Women are still 
the main victim of domestic violence". When the general people think they usually think only physical injuries of 
victims but there are some other ways in which domestic take place, abuse, the force for sex, emotional, economical 
it gives painful pain to the victim mostly this increase during the lockdown.

<h3> 1.1 Characteristics of domestic violence </h3>
<p>     1. Resources for Victims: The law requires victims to be provided with shelter, medical services, and legal 
assistance when needed. [8]
<br> 2. Recommendations under section 14: The recommendations made by the justice of the peace in section 14 of the Act
 are based on a request from both parties or on an order or instructions from the justice of the peace. [8]
</br><br> 3. Security Officer as defined in Article 9: As required by law, a Security Delegate shall be appointed in each region.
 Females are preferably only by females. It is the duty of the official to submit reports of incidents of domestic violence
 and, if necessary, to provide medical and legal assistance to the victims. [8]
</br><br> 4. Residence provided for in Article 19: In order to protect the victim, the justice of the peace may prohibit the 
accused and the victim from meeting by personal, oral, electronic and telephone communication. [8]
</br><br> 5. Compensation under Section 22: Under section 22 of the Act, the justice of the peace may order the defendant to pay a
 certain amount of compensation and compensation to the victim. [8]
</br><br> 6. Article 32 (2): Under Article 32 (2), the court may only presume that the accused has committed a criminal offense in
 the light of the victim's testimony. The crime was declared unrecognizable and inaccessible. [8]
</br><br> 7. Fast trial: The law guarantees a quick trial, as the court must initiate the proceedings within 3 days of the appeal 
and make a decision within 60 days of the date of the hearing. [8]
</br><br> 8. Section 16: Article 16 of Chapter 4 allows a judge to conduct proceedings in secret if one of the parties so wishes. [8]
</br><br> 9. Article 21: Return of custody of the child to the victim. If the judge allows, the respondent may visit the child. [8]
</br><br> 10. Article 20 Financial support: Article 20 of the Act provides for financial assistance to victims of domestic violence.
 Under section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1973, maintenance is paid to the injured party or his children. [8]</br> </P>
<h4> 1.2 Types of Domestic Violence </h4>
<p> <br>1 physical abuse
The most common and easy type of domestic ill-treat is physical abuse. In this type of ill-treatment, the person is physically harmed 
by the other person. For example: In case if the husband beats his better half regularly, the wife can sue him for domestic ill-treatment.
</br><br>2. Sexual abuse
when persons are forced to be involved in sexual activity, forced sex by the spouse s an act of aggression and domestic violence.
</br><br>3. Emotional abuse
Psychological violence includes verbal violence as well as shouting, insults, and blame. Behaviour regulation is also a form of psychological violence.
</br><br>4. Economic abuse
Monetary abuse is a way to command the victim through financial resources.</br>
 </p>
<h2> 2. Impact of Covid-19 Operating Domestic Violence </h2>
<p> Many families around the world are forced to live together, showing a real “emergency”. Chinese statistics, at least in the end (at least for now),
 show more and more reports of domestic violence, especially among women who have been forced into violent relationships for several months. Several
 newspapers reported domestic violence and children were severely abused. In a small apartment or house like China, which fears being abused every day, 
they are forced to isolate themselves, causing tremendous stress and psychological damage. In addition, there is a lack of police oversight of such 
abuses to address public order issues. With the emergence of an emergency in the United States, people are happy to buy guns and alcohol (a dangerous 
mixture). How does all this affect families currently isolated from the abuser at home? Emergency and quarantine measures are still in place in Italy, 
and we are witnessing a completely opposite phenomenon, namely the decline in free calls to combat violence. 
Clearly, the decrease in the number of reports does not reflect a decrease in violence; on the contrary, during the Covid-19 epidemic, the greatest 
risk is that the victim will continue to be trapped in the house by the abuser and have no emergency exit or contact external help. The same goes for 
abused children who are unable to go to school due to isolation and who are reported by teachers or friends.

<h2> 3. Increase in Domestic Violence During Lockdown  </h2>
<p> During lockdown, it found that the increment in domestic violence we can better understand why there are too many increments in domestic violence
 during lockdown with the help of the following factor.
<b><br>Isolation </b></br>
In a lockdown, the people get angry too much in a short time due to a low level of physical activity that can affect their health.
<b><br>Stress</b> </br>
Everyone feels emotional and physical tension. In lockdown it found that about in 100-person 80 people are under stress it will increase domestic 
violence the person who is under stress will get physical with their partner and harm her.
<b></br>Economic Anxiety and Joblessness</b></br> 
During the lockdown, many people lose their job, and due to a lack of money it is hard to survive with their families. It is the main region to increase
 the domestic violence the government will not be able to fix their issue at that time. The lockdown is also known as economic distress.
<b><br>Alcohol  </b></br>
most of the people are alcoholics. About 60% of men take alcohol in their normal daily routine and 20% drink in excess. In the relationship already
 married with violence, the abuse they cannot understand what they do they fight with their partner and abuse.
<b><br>Lack of Resources</b></br> 
A recent study shows that many women don't know their own rights due to not available proper resources. Legal Services of the victim also get delayed due to
 not available proper COVID-19 free jail or shelters.
</p>
<h2> 6. Conclusions </h2>
<p> A recent study shows a decrease in the number of complaints. we believe that restriction during pandemic lockdown has helped to increase domestic violence
 which may be felled by the following term:
<br>a. Isolation 
</br><br>b. increase in stress due to social and economic factor
</br><br>c. no contact of victim to the outside </br>
We propose to the government to thought about the following terms:
<br>●	Increase in awareness of people with the help of ads on T.V or local leaders
</br><br>●	Make a proper law that though the act itself expanded the definition of domestic violence to include not just physical but also verbal, Psychological,
 sexual and monetary violence and provided the scope for urgent, protective injunctions, along with economic rights including maintenance and compensation.
</br><br>●	Fast reporting of victim of domestic violence with the help of toll-free number 
<br>●	Make a perfect online platform for the complaints of domestic violence.</br>
